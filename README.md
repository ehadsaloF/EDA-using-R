## Exploratory Data Analysis on Wages Dataset Using R

<p>In this project, I explored a datset containing the wages of employees.</p> 
<p>The dataset has 7 variables </p>
<ul>
<li> 'married' - Represents the marital status of employee </li>
<li> 'hourly_wage' - Represents the employee's hourly rate </li>
<li> 'years_in_education' - Represents years employee has been in education </li>
<li> 'years_in_employment' - Represents years employee has been in employment </li>
<li> 'num_dependents' - Represents employee's number of dependants </li>
<li> 'gender' - Represents employee's gender </li>
<li> 'race' - Represents employee's race </li>
</ul>
<p>I conducted a statistical test of independence between two potentially related categorical variables, <b>'gender'</b> and <b>'race'</b>, <b>'married'</b> and <b>'race'</b>. </p>
<p> I conducted a statistical test to get the significance of the difference between the means of two subsets of the data.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> The means of the <b>'hourly_wage'</b> of married male and married female employees.
<li> The means of <b>'hourly_wage'</b> of new employees and existing employees .
</ul>
<p> Trained a linear regression model to predict the hourly wage of an employee based on the <b>'married'</b>, <b>'years_in_education'</b>, <b>'years_in_employment'</b> and <b>'gender'</b> variables.
<p> Checked the Classical Linear Regression Method Assupmtions </p>
